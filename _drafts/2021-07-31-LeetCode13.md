## [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/submissions/) :star::star::star:

### Find Cycle in directional graph

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**: 
[Reference](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/discuss/58586/Python-20-lines-DFS-solution-sharing-with-explanation)
1. if node v has not been visited, then mark it as 0.
2. if node v is being visited, then mark it as -1. If we find a vertex marked as -1 in DFS, then their is a ring.
3. if node v has been visited, then mark it as 1. If a vertex was marked as 1, then no ring contains v or its successors.

```python

```
## [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/) :star::star:

### DFS

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**: Use map and stack


```python

```

## [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/) :star::star::star:

### DFS

Time Complexity: $$O(V+E)$$

Space Complexity: $$O(V+E)$$

**Key-Point**: Black node is -1, gray node is 1. Cycle can only be detected when it reaches gray node.


```python

```

### BFS (Kahn's Algorithm)

Time Complexity: $$O(V+E)$$

Space Complexity: $$O(V+E)$$

**Key-Point**: Track all in-degree value of nodes.


```python

```

## [310. Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/) :star::star:
[Ref](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/discuss/479559/Python3-O(n)-with-explanation)
### Leaves BFS 

Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$

Space Complexity: $$O(V+E)$$

**Key-Point**: If the height of a tree with root x is h, then the height of the same tree with the leaves removed and with root x is h - 1. We remove the leaf and it will get to Minimum Height Tree nodes.


```python

```
