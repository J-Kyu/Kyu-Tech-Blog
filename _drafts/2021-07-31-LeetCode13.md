## [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/submissions/) :star::star::star:

### Find Cycle in directional graph

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**: 
[Reference](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/discuss/58586/Python-20-lines-DFS-solution-sharing-with-explanation)
1. if node v has not been visited, then mark it as 0.
2. if node v is being visited, then mark it as -1. If we find a vertex marked as -1 in DFS, then their is a ring.
3. if node v has been visited, then mark it as 1. If a vertex was marked as 1, then no ring contains v or its successors.

```python

```
